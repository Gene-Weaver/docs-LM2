Ruler Detection

Primary options (ruler_detection)
---------------------------------

‚≠ê Set these to save different versions of ruler QC images:

.. code-block:: yaml

    save_ruler_validation: False # the full QC image, includes the squarified image and intermediate steps
    save_ruler_validation_summary: True  # the recommended QC image
    save_ruler_processed: False # just the binary ruler

To limit conversion factor determination to highly confident rulers, set `minimum_confidence_threshold: 0.8`.
We find that `minimum_confidence_threshold: 0.4` is fine in general, though. 

Do not change the detecor names. LM2 v.2.1 only include networks from the publication. Additional networks will be available in future releases. 

.. code-block:: yaml
