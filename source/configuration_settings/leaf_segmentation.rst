Leaf Segmentation

Primary options (leaf_segmentation)
------------------------------------

⭐ Tell LM2 to segment ideal leaves by setting ``segment_whole_leaves: True`` and partial leaves by setting `segment_partial_leaves: False`. In general, there are *many* more partial leaves than ideal leaves. So segmenting partial leaves will *significantly* increase total processing time. Please refer to the publication for a more detailed overview of these settings. 

The LM2 leaf segmentation tool will try to segment all leaves that it sees, but we only want it to find one leaf, so we set ` keep_only_best_one_leaf_one_petiole: True` to tell LM2 to only keep the largest leaf and petiole. This is not perfect, but it gets the job done for now. 

⭐ To save all leaf mask overlays onto the full image as a PDF, set ``save_segmentation_overlay_images_to_pdf: True``

⭐ To save all leaf mask overlays onto the full image as individual images, set ``save_each_segmentation_overlay_image: True```

⭐ This saves each cropped leaf with its overlay to individual files ``save_individual_overlay_images: True`` and this sets the overlay line width ``overlay_line_width: 1``

⭐ LM2 can also save the masks to PNG files. To use the EFDs as the masks (these will be smooth compared to the raw mask) set ``use_efds_for_png_masks: False ``

⭐ To save individual leaf masks, set ``save_masks_color: True``

⭐ To save full image leaf masks, set ``save_full_image_masks_color: True``

⭐ To save the RGB image, set ``save_rgb_cropped_images: True``

⭐ To measure length and width of leaves set ``find_minimum_bounding_box: True``

⭐ To calcualte EFDs set ``calculate_elliptic_fourier_descriptors: True`` and define the desired order with ``elliptic_fourier_descriptor_order: null``, the default is 40, which maintains detail.

We found no real need to change ``minimum_confidence_threshold: 0.7``, but you may find better results with adjustments. 

Do not change the ``segmentation_model``. LM2 v.2.1 only include networks from the publication. Additional networks will be available in future releases.
