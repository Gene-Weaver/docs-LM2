Testing the Installation
========================

Running the installation test from the terminal
-------------------------------------------------

1. Make sure that the virtual environment is active
2. ``cd`` into the LeafMachine2 directory and run ``python test.py`` or ``python3 test.py``
3. You should see some blue text, and then a lot of information in the console. If the run completes (usually after ~5 minutes) and you see a grinning then you should be all set! Otherwise, double check that you followed each step and reach out by submitting an inquiry in the form at https://leafmachine.org
